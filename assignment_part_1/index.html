          1972 PhD in Computer Sciene (While at UCLA, Cerf helped write the
          communication protocol for the Advanced Research Projects Agency
          Network (ARPANET), an early forerunner to the modern Internet.) TCP/IP
          Protocol: We worked for about six months to figure out how do you
          connect a whole bunch of different computer networks together and make
          it look like one net.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), the basic
          communication protocol that dictates how data should be packeted for
          the Internet. (Architecture of the internet) If not for Cerf and
          TCP/IP co-inventor Bob Kahn, we wouldn’t have Wi-Fi, Ethernet, e-mail,
          or many of the other innovations that we currently enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The protocol operated in two layers: the higher TCP layer transmitted
          units of data into packets while the lower IP layer made sure the
          packets reached their intended destination.

          Medal of Technology to Cerf and his colleague, Robert E. Kahn, for
          founding and developing the Internet. In 2004, Cerf was the recipient
          of the ACM Alan M. Turing award (sometimes called the “Nobel Prize of
          Computer Science”) and in 2005 he was given the Presidential Medal of

          “Nobel Prize of Computer Science.” In November 2005, President George
          Bush awarded Cerf and Kahn the Presidential Medal of Freedom for their
          work. The medal is the highest civilian award given by the United
          States to its citizens. In April 2008, Cerf and Kahn received the
          prestigious Japan Prize and in 2013 Cerf, Kahn and three others
          received the Queen Elizabeth Prize in Engineering. Cerf was made an
          officer of the French Legion d’Honneur in December 2014 and Foreign
          Member of the British Royal Society in July 2016. In 2018 together
          with Robert Kahn, he received the Franklin Medal.
